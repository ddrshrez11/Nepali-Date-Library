## Overview

The `NepaliDate` library provides a proper way to work with Nepali (Bikram Sambat) dates in TypeScript/JavaScript. It allows you to create, manipulate, format, and convert between Nepali Bikram Sambat date (1976/01/01 - 2100/12/31) and Gregorian dates (1919-03-13 - 2044-04-12) with support for fiscal years, quarters, and extensive date operations.
